# React Overview (reactive to every change)

Javascript library used to build **Single Page Application (SPA)** UIs with reuseable components.
It also know as frontend JavaScript framework and toolkit to make declarative smalll pieces of code called components.
It is efficient and fexible javaScript JS Library.

  1. [JSX](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/jsx.md): Translate tags into react elements.
  2. [React Components](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/components.md): Small piece of code having UI and its states and related function.
  3. [React Props](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/props.md): Arguments passed into React components.
  4. [Destructuring in React](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/dest.md): Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed in array or in object.
  5. [React Hooks](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/hooks.md): Perform intercepting such call messages or events.
  6. [React Router](https://github.com/arsibux/react-app/blob/main/docs/router.md): HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them.
